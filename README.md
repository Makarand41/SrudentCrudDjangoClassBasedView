# Student Class Management System

A Django-based web application for managing student information. This project allows you to create, update, view, and delete students with their `firstName`, `lastName`, and `testScore`.

## Note

This project uses **Class-Based Views (CBVs)** instead of **Function-Based Views (FBVs)** for handling the views logic. Class-based views provide a more modular and reusable structure for handling various web requests and responses.



By using CBVs, we take advantage of Djangoâ€™s built-in views, reducing boilerplate code and keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Features

- List all students
- View detailed information for each student
- Add a new student
- Update the test score of an existing student
- Delete a student

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
